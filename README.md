# How to use it
## Image Div Replacer
In order to activate the tool, click on the "CT" icon on the top right of your browser once you have installed it.  

When you move your mouse over an element on the webpage, the element is highlighted with a yellow overlay.  

If you target a smaller element, but you want the overlay to cover a larger area, you can press the Up Arrow key. This will cause the overlay to move to the selected element's parents. 

Dragging an image file or a text file containing tags from your desktop to the overlay will replace the selected element with your image/tags. 

In order to close the overlay, click on the "X" button on the top right of the overlay. 
In order to open up the paste option, click on the "P" button on the top right of the overlay. This will open up an prompt dialog where you can paste your tags. 

Paste any tags you have on your clipboard into the text area and click "Okay". This will replace the selected element with your tags. 

Notes: Images or tags may not fit correctly if they are not already tailored to fit the selected element.
